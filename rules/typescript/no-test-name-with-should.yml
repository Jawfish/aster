message: |
  Test names should state facts, not wishes or expectations using "should".

  Our test naming philosophy:
  - A test is an atomic fact about system behavior
  - Tests are specifications, not aspirations
  - Use declarative language that states what IS, not what SHOULD BE
  - Tests document actual behavior with confidence

  Why avoid "should":
  - "Should" sounds aspirational or uncertain
  - Tests verify facts, not hypotheticals
  - Weakens the authority of tests as specifications
  - Creates distance between test and the behavior it verifies

  Example refactoring:
    // Before: Aspirational language
    test("player should respawn at checkpoint")
    test("game should pause when window loses focus")
    test("damage should not exceed max health")

    // After: Factual language
    test("player respawns at checkpoint")
    test("game pauses when window loses focus")
    test("damage does not exceed max health")

  This is a simple but important distinction - your tests are executable specifications
  of how the system behaves, not suggestions for how it might behave.

  any:
    - pattern: test($NAME, $$$)
    - pattern: it($NAME, $$$)
constraints:
  NAME:
    regex: should
