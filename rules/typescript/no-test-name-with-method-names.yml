  Test names should describe behavior, not reference implementation methods.

  Our test naming philosophy:
  - Focus on what the system does, not how it's tested
  - Use plain English that non-programmers can understand
  - Follow the ACE framework: Action, Condition, Expectation
  - Tests document behavior, not code structure

  Why avoid method names in tests:
  - Tests coupled to method names break when you refactor
  - Method names are implementation details, not user behavior
  - Tests should survive renaming and restructuring
  - Behavior is what matters, not the specific function name

  Naming pattern to follow:
  1. **Action**: What functionality is being tested
  2. **Condition**: Under what circumstances
  3. **Expectation**: With what expected result

  Example refactoring:
    // Before: References method name
    test("calculateDamage returns correct value")
    test("getUserById fetches from database")
    test("isPlayerDead checks zero health")

    // After: Describes behavior
    test("damage is attack power minus defense")
    test("user is fetched by unique identifier")
    test("player with zero health is dead")

  See testing guidelines for more details and examples.
