  Test names should state facts, not wishes or expectations using "should".

  Our test naming philosophy:
  - A test is an atomic fact about system behavior
  - Tests are specifications, not aspirations
  - Use declarative language that states what IS, not what SHOULD BE
  - Tests document actual behavior with confidence

  Why avoid "should":
  - "Should" sounds aspirational or uncertain
  - Tests verify facts, not hypotheticals
  - Weakens the authority of tests as specifications
  - Creates distance between test and the behavior it verifies

  Example refactoring:
    # Before: Aspirational language
    def test_player_should_respawn_at_checkpoint():
    def test_game_should_pause_when_window_loses_focus():

    # After: Factual language
    def test_player_respawns_at_checkpoint():
    def test_game_pauses_when_window_loses_focus():

  This is a simple but important distinction - your tests are executable specifications
  of how the system behaves, not suggestions for how it might behave.
