aster - Cross-language lint rules

Usage:
    aster lint <target>        Run all checks on target directory (default)
    aster diff                 Run all checks on unstaged changes (like git diff)
    aster diff <base>          Run all checks on changes vs base branch
    aster staged               Run all checks on staged changes
    aster test                 Test the rules themselves
    aster help                 Show this help

Examples:
    aster lint ~/code/myproject     # Full lint on directory
    aster lint .                    # Full lint on current directory
    aster diff                      # Check only unstaged changes
    aster diff main                 # Check only changes vs main
    aster diff origin/develop       # Check only changes vs develop
    aster staged                    # Check only staged changes (pre-commit)
    aster test                      # Verify rules work
